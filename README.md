##  Consider Your Audience

The goal of this presentation is to enable you to create compelling graphs that effectively communicate a statistical analysis of data. A guiding maxim is to always consider your audience. An audience of lay people has different needs from an audience of technical experts. These tips are intended for technical audiences who are statistically literate.
